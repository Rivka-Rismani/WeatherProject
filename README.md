# WeatherProject
There are two possibilities of running the database:

1 Run the file located inside the sql folder


2 Go to the Startup file inside the c # folder and download the MocFavoriteCitiesService comment and put the FavoriteCitiesService in the comment

* Do not forget to do npm i.

* And modify the ConnectionStrings in the appsetings file

Thanks
